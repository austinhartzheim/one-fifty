# One-Fifty

The evidence is clear: physical activity leads to numerous benefits, both mental and physical. To achieve benefits, the CDC recommends that adults perform 150-minutes of physical activity every week, including your daily walk to work or school. The only catch is that these activities must be performed for at least 10-minutes to be beneficial.

One-Fifty cuts away the noise of other fitness trackers by only showing you the qualifying time you spent exercising. While getting out of your desk for a quick walk across the office probably isn't hurting your health, you aren't exactly pushing your aerobic capacity either. One-Fifty only counts your walking when it occurs for 10-minutes or more.
